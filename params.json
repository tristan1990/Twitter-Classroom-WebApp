{"name":"Twitter-Classroom-Web App","tagline":"Really small little app, perfect for use in the classroom. Downloads a PDF of your (fake) tweet... students love it.","body":"### What is this about.\r\nThis is a little app I created for students to use in the classroom. Ideally it is used at the end of a lesson so that students can leave a 'tweet' about what they have learned. I'd love to collaborate with other educators on this, I think it could be really interesting to hear peoples ideas.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nTristan Kirkpatrick - 2015\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with the app?
